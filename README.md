My personal blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A full Ruby development environment capable of running Jekyll. For more information about installing Jekyll and a Ruby development environment see Jekyll's documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### Installing

1.  After cloning, install Jekyll and the bundler gems:

    ```shell
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```

1.  Build the site and make it available on a local server.

    ```shell
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

## Deployment

For GitHub Pages, the site is automatically built with each git push.

Alternatively, the `_site` folder can be used copied to the desired hosting location.

## Built With

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - A static site generator.
