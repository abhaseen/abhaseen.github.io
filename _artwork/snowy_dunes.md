The goal of this art piece was to make a concept showcasing the aesthetics and feel of the area. The area is described as mountainous scattered with few mysterious ruins spread across the landscape.

This was inspired by Ko-Koro from the first generation of Bionicle which was an a frosty moutainous area inhabited by stone structures with a few giant statues scattered here and there.
