The concept illustrated here is a rendition of one of the dungeons in the game. The goal of illustrating this piece is to convey an idea of the narrative for this area of gameplay as well as the sequence of events needed to complete the quest-line in this dungeon. The concept art here is created to leave a lot of room for improvisation and creative input for the level designers. The piece's primary goal is to conceptualize a narrative plot and overall aesthetic.

The center piece is an inverted tower which encases the deity of destruction. In order to defeat the immensely powerful foe, the protagonist must cut the chainlinks inside the tower and make his escape before the tower can plunge into the pit of lava below. The idea of the dungeon is a prison complex created to contain the most wretched of ancient evils that could not be vanquished.

In the above image players can enter the dungeon and go through the first floor. On that floor they will find an elevator that allows them to descend to the lower level of the dungeon. From there, they will have to make their way through the inverted city complex before reaching the main centerpiece inverted tower in the centre of the city.

Above is the early rendtion.

In the updated version, it was completely redrawn from scratch. This time I drew it using a two point perspective allowing for a better sense of realism and proportioning. I also added more surrounding buildings to better convey the idea that it is an inverted city.
