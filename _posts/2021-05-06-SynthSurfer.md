This was a fully developed game for my Game Development Fundamentals course. The project was made in Unreal Engine 4.

# Showcase of the Project

This game was a unique retro-futuristic hoverboarding that featured a grinding mechanic, multiple enemies, 6 different levels (including a final boss fight) and an awesome soundtrack.
