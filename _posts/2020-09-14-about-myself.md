Hi, my name is Andre. I am a software development student at Seneca College. I took this course in Open Source because I was interested in making my own _fancy_ open source projects as well as being able to contribute to other people's projects. I think being able to contribute to other people's projects and help them build a better software is one of the things which really brings out the very best part about the internet. People are able to share ideas and improve and embetter the community and world around them as well as improving their own skills.

One particular open source project that really changed my life would be Blender. For those of you who don't know, Blender is a 3D modeling and animation software. I first picked up using Blender in University when one of my friends told me they had 3D printers in the library. From there, I went on create 3D models to 3D print and now I even make assets for Cities Skylines. Not only that but because I learned animation, it lead me to picking up so many other things such as: Graphic Design, traditional hand drawing, digital drawing and special FX which I really enjoy. (You can see my projects [here](https://accentorstudios.com/)) If this wasn't a free and open source project, I most likely would never have gotten into all of the things I just mentioned. So Open Source projects really mean _a lot_ to me!

In terms of things I personally have an interest in programming are: hobby/toy robotics as well as application programs. (For example, my multi-instrument application which allows you to play the piano or drums in Java, which I made with a good friend of mine.) In terms of programming languages, my favorite, not necessarily my most used would be: C++, Assembly and Verilog HDL. (Though I'd probably never end-up using Verilog...) My most used languages are: JavaScript, Java and C++.

This term, I'm looking to work on projects that I find interesting, still not sure, but I have a vague idea of what I'd like to do. I'm thinking of things involving graphics or maybe something in front-end web development. Ultimately, if I find something that interests me other than those two subjects, I may pursue that instead. I'm also looking in terms of languages, if it's C++, I'd definitely jump on the oppurtunity of doing something with graphics like particle effects generations for rendering/game engines.

For the trending Github Repos, I chose [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) which is documented [here](https://gorm.io/docs/). I chose this because I heard a lot of good things about Golang and I hope to learn it one day. This project was made to simplify using SQL databases in Golang. As I was looking through the documentation, I noticed there were a lot of similarities to JavaScript's Mongoose. So it would be familiar territory for anyone coming in from Web Development. Projects like these help to simplify the workflow of programmers. It allows people to easily integrate/implement code from another language into their language of choice.
