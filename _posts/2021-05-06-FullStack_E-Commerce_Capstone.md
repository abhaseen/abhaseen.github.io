# Skills Used and Things I Learned

## Learning Experience

This project was a group project that required creating both a working front-end and back end. It really put my skills to the test as it required some complex things like uplaoding dynamic files and setting up a clean looking front-end that is both accessible and visually apealing. Additionally, setting up a cart and checkout that works with the rest of the site was also a challenge.

## Skills Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React
