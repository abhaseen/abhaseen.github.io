# Introduction

For Release 0.3, I decided to tackle the long lost issue #77 in the CDOT/telescope repo for my contribution to the telescope repo. In addition to this, I was also working on a Python project that my friend had in his backlog. A very interesting project... I decided to wait a while before writing this to really be able to tell my full experiences of these projects. (And also because I'm lagging behind in a lot of school work...)

# Adding Dark Theme to Telescope Website

So there were a few things that I had to work on for this part. I also noticed while doing this project, that there's so many files and calls from all over the place. At first it was very confusing, even frustrating, but as time went on, I got the hang of it and was able to tell what was what and where things were. I couldn't have done it without the Inspect Element, the saving grace of this coding session.

The first thing that was worked on was getting it set up so that we'd have multiple colors being stored via a unary operator on a variable. Originally, we'd have the theme determined by what is selected by the user's browser's preference. Then the next order of things was to make sure everything was following the [Material UI Hook API](https://material-ui.com/styles/advanced/). The first iteration of this [pull request](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope/pull/1414) was alright, but it was clear there was still work needed to be done, after having a review from [agarcia-caicedo](https://github.com/agarcia-caicedo), we decided it'd be great to have a toggle feature for the user should they wish to change between dark and light mode.

This lead to the second iteration of the pull request. This also lead to resolving some color contrast issues: we were originally using this color: #0589D6 - a shade of blue that was a bit too dark, so I changed this color to: #35b4ff which is a much better contrast. The visited links didn't really have a dedicated color, so for the dark theme, I chose pink and for the light theme I chose purple. And finally, I added a button that allows you to switch between the two themes via the navbar.

Here are some screenshots of what the button looks like:

and

**For the light theme**

If you're interested in the technicalities this works by having a bool variable and negating it upon pressing the button.

There were a few things here and there that needed changes afterwards such as the About Page and the Search Page.

The hardest part of this endeavour was to figure where everything was and how to rebase a repository. A lot of code was altered in terms of making the color scheme uniform, certain objects would call odd colors that seemingly were not part of the theme. For example, it would use the primary or secondary instead of using the text-specific primary or secondary. Also there was a bit of duplication going along the way because there was separate code for both mobile and desktop. (If someone is looking for a thing to solve, consider trying to make those two into a single responsive design file.)

This was a really fun thing to work on. Definitely a bit of a challenge, but at least everything is visual, so you can actually see the changes you make as you go along.

As a treat here are some screenshots of what this looks like:

# Speech to Text to Voice

The title must certainly be confusing. So let be explain what this project is about. I had originally intended to make a PR solving some issue in LMMS, but just getting the dependencies to work for that project was impossible. (They are not as well organized as our beloved Telescope.) So, I turned to ask my friend if he had anything in progress that I could work on. [SparrowOchon](https://github.com/SparrowOchon) is one of my closest friends that I've always looked up to especially concerning programming. The project he was working on was a forked [text to speech app](https://github.com/SparrowOchon/HawkingSays) that replicated the voice of the late Stephen Hawking. He was trying to get a script to basically make this into a voice changer. The way this would work is you have a mic input detected, then that mic input goes through a speech recognition algorithm (Google's in this case) and then it will convert it to text and pipe it into the shell that is used for input for the text to speech.

This was a bit of a challenge at first. But I was able to get a script working which will take in mic input and then convert it to a .wav file which will then be sent to a recognition software to convert to text. The only thing that's left to do is to make it pipe the text into the shell created by the main script (that uses Hawking's voice.)

At first, getting the dependencies set up was quite difficult. Because I didn't realise there are two versions of Python each with their separate set of packages. In this case, I had to download Python3-Dev rather than the usual Python. This fixed everything.

This was probably the most fun I had programming in a long time. This was a fun and practicle project that allowed me to become aware of several libraries such as pyaudio and speech recognition. As well as invoking a shell instance. [This](https://github.com/SparrowOchon/HawkingSays/pull/1) is the pull request.

# Interesting thing of the Week

I'll keep this brief, because working on the Telescope site front-end made me realize how long these articles can actually go on...

![SpaceX Dragon Interior](/images/SpaceXDragon.jpg)

Last weekend, SpaceX launched their Dragon Space Capsule that docked at the International Space Station. I realized that a lot of the process is automated. This really got me thinking about the software used abord the Dragon Capsule.

It is known that the [SpaceX Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon) Flight Software is programmed in C++.

[According to an AMA (Ask Me Anything)](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/9243/what-computer-and-software-is-used-by-the-falcon-9) that they did, they also revealed that they use LabView for Data Acquision from sensors. Additionally, they also revealed that the OS aboard the Dragon is a derivative of Linux. Apart from that, the nature of this software is mostly classified since Rocket technology can be very easily misused. But nonetheless, this was definitely very interesting to learn a bit more about how these things work. If I could get the chance somewhere in the future, I would love to work on the flight control systems for this!
