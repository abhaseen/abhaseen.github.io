This GUI project made in Java served the purposed of making an app where the user can play various different musical instruments.

# Showcase of the Project

This is probably my favorite programming project I made. It contains a variety of features. It allows you to play the piano, drums (acoustic or electronic) as well as allowing you to record your voice or play a backing track. The design and feel of the instruments is based on their appearance in reality to allow the user to easily familiarize themselves with the controls.
