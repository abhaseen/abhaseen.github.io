# Introduction

This week, lab1, we had to make a URL verification script that works through the command line. I chose to do this in Python since I had learned it this summer and it was still fresh in my mind. Also I realize that the blog posts were supposed to be split, but I wanted to keep them merged otherwise I would be rehasing a lot of what I was saying.

# Making the Lab

For this lab, my focus was to make a scripting using robust coding practices. It took me a while to figure everything out, my biggest challenges were:

- Figuring out how to use an argument without anything after it.
  - Solved by using argparse's action property
- How to handle the program if there was no argument entered.
  - Solved by using the the sys.argv length
- Parsing the HTML and analyzing it
  - Solved using beautiful soup and lxml

I was able to implement a lot of good features:

- `-?` and `--?` commands
- Support for `-v` and `--version` which displays the verion of the tool
- Support for `-u` and `--url` to search for a single website response
- Color support
- Core program (verifying a file containing HTML supported)
- Exceptions for Timeouts and Refused Connections (as well as a message depicting it)
- Range support for more than just 200 and 400 error codes.

# Reviewing the Lab

Royce, who I messaged took a look at my code and reviewed it, he left me with valuable feedback concerning both the readme and the program. He tested it vigorously and found an exception being thrown when it was given a file that doesn't exist in the folder.

I was able to review Ruby's, Nesa's and Royce's code, I have to say, their work was very solid and all issues were minor or symantic errors.

# The Program

After making this program, I was really happy with the outcome, my focus for making it robust seemed to have paid off! I was especially happy with the colors. The documentation was a thrill to do as well.

So let me talk a little bit about the program and how to use it.

If you'd like to try out the code for yourself, you can find it [here](https://github.com/abhaseen/Verify-URL).

The main goal of the program was to get it be a script that it can be used out of the box. So making it so that if you have an HTML file in a folder that's shared with your script you can run it straight away.

## Setting it Up

First off, if you don't already have it, you'll need Python3 to run this script.

To begin, you may have to set up a virtual environment. The instructions are as listed below:

Create the environment in the folder you plan on having the .py script file in.

```shell
    python3 -m venv env
```

The above line should <u>only</u> be ran **the first time** you set up your folder

Once it has been created, you will want to run the source command:

```shell
    source [location_of_your_folder/env/bin/activate]
```

You will know if it worked or not if you see `(env)` infront of where you would input your command line operations. (Just see the pictures above, it should look similar.)

Next after doing that, we'd have to install the dependencies, like so:

After that, you'll want get the requests library by typing this into your command line:

```shell
    pip install requests
```

In order to parse HTML files into Python, we need to use Beautiful Soup:

```shell
    pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Then we have to use the lxml to process the HTML file:

```shell
    pip install lxml
```

Since this program uses emoji's you'll want to make sure you have the latest UTF-8 characters standard so that everything displays properly.

## Using the Program

Once the above things have been done, you're now ready to use the program.

Let's get started, if we wanted to get help to know the commands, we can either just type in the script name in the command line or we can use `-h/--help`:

![Default Help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhaseen/Verify-URL/master/docs/DefaultHelp.png)

Now, we can also check the version of this tool using the `-v/--version` argument:

![Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhaseen/Verify-URL/master/docs/Version.png)

We can also use the `-u/--url` argument to test the return code of a single website:

![Single URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhaseen/Verify-URL/master/docs/SingleURL.png)

Additionally, if we incorrectly type the `-u/--url` argument without providing it with content, it will return a warning.

![Single URL Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhaseen/Verify-URL/master/docs/SingleURLError.png)

As for the main program, if wew were to pass to it a valid file inside the same folder as the script, it will run like so:

# Interesting thing of the Week

In order to reward readers for reading this far, I thought I'd talk about something interesting once every week. Don't worry, it's all tech related.

So this week, a <i>Halo</i> game called <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> released on Steam. Now the game itself is a blast, but what really interests me are the different technologies they use in the game. The story and world itself is sci-fi, but some of the technologies actually exist and it was cool to see their interpretation of how things wind up in the future.

There are really three technologies in it that I really want to talk about:

- The Helmets
- The AI
- VISR

## The Helmets

The ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) are spec ops marines that have very specialized gear and armor. Their most distinctive feature besides their drop pods are their [helmets](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/ODST_battle_armor). In the game these helmets are depicted to have a visor that is made of [electrochromatic glass](https://www.sageglass.com/en/article/what-electrochromic-glass). Think of it like sunglasses that you can turn on and off at will. The way this glass works is by having a device that will excite the state of the ions so that it will activate a tint or clear. These things can be programmed by programming the device that will excite the glass to recieve a signal from a remote.

## The AI

The <i>Halo</i> franchise is no stranger to exploring the potential advancements of AI in 500yrs from now... it's kind of a staple in the series. They futher explore this with a different take on an AI in their world. In the future city of New Mombassa, they utilize an AI know as the <i>[Superintendent](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Superintendent)</i> that takes care of operating the city. This is interesting because it seems to be an advancement of modern-day smart cities mixed with machine learning being used to keep things operational even in the event of a major emergency or catastrophe.

## VISR

This was actually the most interesting thing to me. The [VISR](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Visual_Intelligence_System,_Reconnaissance) is a HUD (Heads Up Display) system that combines AR with machine learning object recognition. This system is quite advanced as it acts as night vision and even outlines ennemies, allies and objects. Such technologies actually exist in reality. We see things like [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) and [Google AR](https://arvr.google.com/ar/) which focus on setting up an augmented reality environment without the hassle of scanning and trying to identify objects yourself programmatically. Those two libraries can be used with Unity to create an app. VISR sort of reminded me of that except it's more advanced and has night vision.
